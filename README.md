Steps for learning a new language

1. Identify online resources (short courses and language documentation, videos)

2. Do a short course or tutorial on the basics on codecademy, odin project, app academy or similar site for a quick insight into the language
- https://www.codecademy.com/learn
- https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard
- https://open.appacademy.io/
- https://stackskills.com/courses/

3. Identify some of the most commonly used methods in the languages that i'm familiar with already and try to find how these are translated into the new language

4. Look at how to get visibility into what the code is doing so you can track what it is doing but also what it is not. p, debugger, console.log(), js console, irb etc


--  Learning Javascript - My experience --

I tried to learn via translation to begin with and searched for the methods etc that i have used in other languages but i realised that despite knowing the keywords and the new methods, i didn't know the data structure...how js reads the code and what it is specifically looking for. Next, i went to codecademy to go through the JS course to get an idea of the structure and the syntax. This helped me a lot as it actually explained why things were needed and pointed out the important syntax to include or not forget! Learning in small sections and then doing small tasks to practise what you've learnt is a much more efficient way to take in a new language. I wish i had started with this.


Code written so far

walkthrough was heavily relied on as there was a lot of unfamiliar content. Commenting used to make sure that i know what code is doing what or talking to which bits of the app so that i can refer to it in the future.

walkthrough version. My pair for the exercise, Sam King has the version that we walked through.
- ￼￼codecademy 50% progress so far through the JS    courses. Badges for modules can be seen on the profile   page. (I have screenshots).


Self-reflection
- Start with a course going through the basics first and then allow yourself to find the most common methods or keywords in the language you want because without an idea of the structure and the syntax then it won't work.
- I should have finished codecademy before i tried to code some more complex problems because the time i wasted on being stuck wasn't worth it. Get the basics first and then add to it with things you think will be useful so the foundation is there.
- Pairing for me didn't go well, apart from towards the end of the exercise, because we all had such scattered and inconsitent knowledge. We all tried to learn via translation first and all covered simple things like creating a variable, how to make a method but nobody knew the structure the code needed to be in or where we would even put what we learnt or whether we would be able to access it.
- If i did this again, i would sit down with headphones on and just work through an online free short course and then find small simple programs that i know in another language and convert them to the new language.
